Adds god level items in Minecraft. 

Plugin is meant to be a fun thing to mess around with, possibly add these items to crates or something like that. There are currently over 10
items, and I plan on adding to them.

Two of the items are disabled, for balance reasons.

Current active items:

Portable Crafting Table: Right click to open a workbench. Pretty straightforward. \n
Porcupine: Right click to surround yourself in thorns, reflecting damage back to attackers.\n
Mjolnir: Right click to summon lightning.\n
Shadow Demons: Right click to summon a pack of shadow demons that will attack nearby players and mobs.\n
Disco Ball: Right click to summon a fiery ball of death that shoots lasers down at nearby entities.\n
Necronomicon: Right click to bathe in your enemies' fear, sensing their presence through walls.\n
Hermes Boots: Equip to double jump.\n
Stormbreaker: Like Mjolnir, but a lot better.\n
Flamethrower: Pretty self explanatory, hold right click to shoot fire and lava. <-- Still being worked on.\n
Zeus's DNA: Drink the potion to infuse yourself with bits of God DNA, giving yourself a massive boost.\n

Got any ideas for new items? Make an issue request, or message me on discord @GMX#2345
