## Adds god level items in Minecraft. 

Please note this plugin was built against 1.12.2 PAPER spigot.
You can find a version built against normal 1.12.2 spigot on my spigotmc profile.


Plugin is meant to be a fun thing to mess around with, possibly add these items to crates or something like that. There are currently over 10
items, and I plan on adding to them.

Two of the items are disabled, for balance reasons.

Current active items:

**Portable Crafting Table**: Right click to open a workbench. Pretty straightforward. <br/>
**Porcupine**: Right click to surround yourself in thorns, reflecting damage back to attackers.<br/>
**Mjolnir**: Right click to summon lightning.<br/>
**Shadow Demons**: Right click to summon a pack of shadow demons that will attack nearby players and mobs.<br/>
**Disco Ball**: Right click to summon a fiery ball of death that shoots lasers down at nearby entities.<br/>
**Necronomicon**: Right click to bathe in your enemies' fear, sensing their presence through walls.<br/>
**Hermes Boots**: Equip to double jump.<br/>
**Stormbreaker**: Like Mjolnir, but a lot better.<br/>
**Flamethrower**: Pretty self explanatory, hold right click to shoot fire and lava. <-- Still being worked on.<br/>
**Zeus's DNA**: Drink the potion to infuse yourself with bits of God DNA, giving yourself a massive boost.<br/>

Got any ideas for new items? Make an issue request, or message me on discord @GMX#2345
